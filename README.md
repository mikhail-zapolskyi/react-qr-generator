# Free QR Code Generator

The app is a QR code generator that allows users to input a QR link and text, and generate a corresponding QR code image. The app is built using React and includes components for displaying the QR code image, a form for inputting the link and text, and buttons for resetting the form and downloading the generated QR code as a PDF file.

The app uses the jspdf library to generate a PDF file of the QR code image and includes error handling to ensure that the QR link input field is not left blank. Additionally, the app includes a message component that displays an error message if the QR link field is left blank. The app is designed to be responsive, with the width of the generated QR code image adjusted to fit the user's device screen size.
